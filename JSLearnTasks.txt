const NewAnsArr=[];
for(let arr of Arr151) NewAnsArr.push(arr.pop);
for(let arr of Arr151) console.log(arr);
console.log("Arr Ans with unshift and pop: ",NewAnsArr)
Let's see why t is not working 
33. 
console.log("Duppliate Values: ", [...Dup1])
So here does the [...] directly convert the Set to Array 
34. So basically what is the
